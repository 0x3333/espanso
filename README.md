#### What is a Text Expander?

A *text expander* is a program that detects when you type
a specific **keyword** and replaces it with **something else**. 
This is useful in many ways:
* **Save a lot of typing**, expanding common sentences.
* Create **system-wide** code snippets.
* Execute **custom scripts**
* Use **emojis** like a pro.

* Works with almost **any program**
* Works with **Emojis** ðŸ˜„
* **Date** expansion support
* **Custom scripts** support
* **Shell commands** support
* **App-specific** configurations
* File based configuration

## Installation

### <a name="install-windows"></a>Windows

The installation on Windows is pretty straightforward, navigate to the
[Release](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/releases) page and
download the latest installer ( usually named like 
`espanso-win-0.1.0.exe` ).

Because espanso is not digitally signed, you may experience a warning from
Windows Smartscreen. In this case, just click on "More info" (1) and then
on "Run anyway" (2), as shown in the picture:

If you completed the installation procedure, you should have espanso running.
A good way to find out is by going on any text field and typing `:espanso`. 
You should see "Hi there!" appear.

### <a name="install-linux"></a>Linux

### <a name="install-macos"></a>MacOS

The easiest way to install espanso on macOS using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
package manager, but you can also do it manually.

#### Using Homebrew

The first thing to do is to add the official espanso *tap* to Homebrew with
the following command:

```
brew tap federico-terzi/espanso
```

Then you can install espanso with:

```
brew install espanso
```

To make sure that espanso was correctly installed, you can open a terminal and type:

```
espanso --version
```

At this point, you have to [Enable Accessibility](#enabling-accessibility) to use espanso.

#### Enabling Accessibility

Because espanso uses the macOS [Accessibility API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Accessibility/Conceptual/AccessibilityMacOSX/)
to work, you need to authorize it using the following procedure:

Open a terminal and type the command:

```
espanso install
```

A dialog should show up, click on "Open System Preferences", as shown here:

![Accessibility Prompt](images/accessibility-prompt.png)

Then, in the "Privacy" panel click on the Lock icon (1) to enable edits and 
then check "espanso" (2), as shown in the picture:

![Accessibility Settings](images/accessibility-macos-enable.png)

Now open the terminal again and type:

```
espanso install
```

If everything goes well, you should see the espanso icon appear in the status bar:

![macOS status bar icon](images/espanso-icon-macos-statusbar.png)

If you now type `:espanso` in any text field, you should see "Hi there!" appear!
